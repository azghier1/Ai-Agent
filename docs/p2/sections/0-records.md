| Omor Igiehon | Domain model diagram for 5.1 (draw.io source and image, committed to his fork and merged by John). Reviewed Daniel's section 7 and 5.2 UC-02. The 5.1 class table, 5.2 UC-01 and 5.3 assigned to him were not done; John completed them | Fork OmiIgi/Ai-Agent, branch docs/p2-omor-domainModel, merged in PR #9: `e150b01`, `61d01db`, `959a139`, `980fda8` | PR #2 (Daniel), PR #3 (Daniel) |

## 0.2 Changes since the P1 baseline

| Change ID | What changed (IDs affected) | Why (P1 feedback, new finding, spike result) | Knock-on effect | Agreed on |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| CH-01 | Repository in use: every P2 section reaches `main` through a reviewed pull request; 0.1 cites commit hashes and PR numbers | P1 feedback (C4, C5): the repository had no commits, so conventions and contributions could not be verified | 10.4 describes the layout and the PR rule; the contribution record is checkable | Nov 8 |
| CH-02 | LMS changed from Canvas to self-hosted Moodle 5.3 (CON-01 reworded; 1.1 and 1.3 updated; Q1 closed) | Canvas Lite, the free hosted Canvas, blocks personal API tokens for every account, so the agent could not connect. Moodle's web-service API works from a self-hosted instance | ADR-02; R1 closed; sample data loaded into Moodle (R3); the LMS adapter is Moodle-specific | Nov 7 |
| CH-03 | Feasibility verdicts in section 2 tied to evidence | P1 feedback (C1): verdicts were conditional with no checkable evidence. The prototype now makes working calls against a self-hosted LMS API (commits `b5c18f7`, `c5ee6e5`) | Technical feasibility rests on the prototype; performance feasibility waits on spike S-01 (section 8) | Nov 8 |
| CH-04 | Stakeholder needs in 2.2: a five-question student survey replaces assumption as the method | P1 feedback (C1): needs were stated as assumptions | Survey results are tracked in Q4 until reported | Nov 8 |
| CH-05 | Use-case IDs reconciled to UC-01 to UC-04 (3.4); the P1 matrix's UC-05 reference corrected to UC-04 | P1 feedback (C3): matrix referred to UC-03 and UC-05 while the diagram showed UC-01 to UC-04 | Section 4 and the matrix in 9.1 use the same four IDs | Nov 8 |
| CH-06 | QR-02 reworded with task, population, threshold, time limit and sample size | P1 feedback (C3): QR-02 could not be tested | QR-02 is now verifiable by a 10-student usability test | Nov 8 |
| CH-07 | Contribution record cites real repository evidence | P1 feedback: the contribution table said repository links were "to be added" | 0.1 | Nov 8 |
| CH-08 | Use-case detail moved from 3.4 to section 4; the P1 matrix in 3.5 replaced by a pointer to 9.1 | P2 template structure | No content lost; IDs preserved | Nov 8 |
| CH-09 | Document version numbering: P1 baseline renumbered 0.5 | P1 was issued as "1.0"; the P2 baseline must be 1.0 | Revision history above | Nov 8 |
| CH-10 | Campus sign-in constraint (2.4) is **not implemented** in the prototype: the chat service does not authenticate users and reads Moodle with one configured test-student token. Per-student sign-in through LTI 1.3 is planned for P3 | Prototype finding; raised in review of PR #6 | ADR-05; QAS-02 not yet demonstrable; R7 | Nov 8 |
| CH-11 | Plan, risks and open questions updated (10.2, 10.3, 11): R1 closed, R6 to R8 added, Q1 to Q3 closed, Q4 to Q6 added | Analysis and design findings, platform change | Sections 10 and 11 | Nov 8 |
